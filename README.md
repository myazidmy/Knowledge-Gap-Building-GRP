Knowledge Gap Bridging, or our presentation name Thinkr, has been an interesting project with a unique goal to accomplish. Itâ€™s a website where users will be able to search for any goal topic they desire to learn and Thinkr will automatically create a tree of nodes with subtopics toward the goal topic embedded inside them. 

This project not only supplies convenience to our users, but also is a project that has not been attempted before as there are a few projects which have fixed database create these node leaves, Thinkr will be able to create trees for any topic through its algorithm where it will filter out links from Wikipedia to create child nodes and leaflets to form the overall tree.
